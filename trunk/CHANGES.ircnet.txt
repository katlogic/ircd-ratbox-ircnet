IRCNet support for ratbox 3.1
=============================

User-visible features implemented for IRCNet compatibility:
-----------------------------------------------------------
	* !channels (same semantics of creating as on IRCNet,
	   additionaly conflicting names are reported)
	* +r for !channels (identical to IRCNet)
	* +a (anonymous) flag for !channels
	  DIFFERENCES: channel members will NOT see joins/parts at all,
	  (except their own, of course).
	  "Censorship" to anonymous!anonymous. is applied to everything,
	  including targets of +o/+v modechanges.
	* +R for &, # and !channels, channel { reop = 300 }; in config
	  DIFFERENCES: when channel is opless and there is no user matching
	  among the current members, a joining user matching +R will be always
	  let in no matter the current +bilk flags (2.11 overrides only limits).
	* chandelay (channel { delay = 1800; } in config) will enable
	  channel locking when @user is lost in a netsplit and the channel gets
	  empty.
	* channel { no_ops_on_netsplit = yes } - IRCNet-like splitmode

TS6 -> 2.11 emulation
---------------------
	* SJOIN is translated to NJOIN, including appropiate MODEs if necessary
	* UID is translated to UNICK
	* PASS password TS 6 SID -> PASS password 0211030199 IRC|aCDEFHJKMQRTu P
	* TMODE is translated to MODE
	* BMASK is translated to MODE +bbb as appropiate
2.11 -> TS6 emulation
---------------------
	* NJOIN is translated to SJOIN with TS 0
	* UNICK is translated to UID with TS 0

This should make IRCNet compatibility pretty stable as we pass everything needed.
A joining user from a 2.11 server will clear the current TS to zero.
This should enforce no-TS behaviour on a mixed net, after all the servers
are switched to ratbox, a special backdoor command could be used to re-TS channels.

As a safety-net measure for development, in any case we would be spewing
SQUIT or KILL in COMPAT_211 mode, we'd rather SQUIT ourselves from that
uplink. This should prevent the mayhem in case something goes very wrong
(and making ratbox servers linked to IRCNet developer-only as they'll
squit on the first sign of trouble making them useless for users now).
